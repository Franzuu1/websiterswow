            <h2>Wheels 4 Rent</h2>

            <p class="pdesc">This is our first major project for our Event Driven subject.
                <br>
                This emulates a reservation system for a renting service
                <br>
                for cars and can include a driver.
                <br>
                <br>
                This was made in Visual Studio and used C# as our language.

            <h2>QuizZap</h2>

            <p class="pdesc">This was our project for Application Development. Unfortunately, it is incomplete.
                <br>
                This was supposed to emulate an online multiplayer quiz game that lets a user
                <br>
                create their own questions and compete on who can answer the most for points.
                <br>
                <br>
                This was made in Visual Studio Code and used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as our language.

            <p class="pdesc">This was from our last activity for Data Structures back in 2nd Year. This

                simulates a department store interaction between an automated salesperson
